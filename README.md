# Responsive Weather Forecast App
My improved design for a weather forecast app with a city search function and a 5-day forecast. Built in ReactJS using a weather API. Made responsive with a combination of CSS and bootstrap, then deployed on Netlify.

## Features  
- Box section layout built in ReactJS
- Detailed current weather section
- Simplified 5-day forecast summary
- Switch button between °C and °F
- User-friendly design using favicon icons

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install the required packages:  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/chardi90/react-forecast.git  
cd react-forecast  
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

## Usage  

You may want to research alternative weather apis. This project currently uses:
[SheCodes Weather API](https://www.shecodes.io/learn/apis/weather)

- API key required

## Development Ideas

If I were to develop this project further I would:
1. Find another or switch to an alternative API that offers sunrise, sunset times.
2. Create an hourly forecast section with accruate precipitation and wind forecast for the current day (again would require a different API).
